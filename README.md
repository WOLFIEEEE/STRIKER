# Kicker Game using Pygame in Python

This Python script is a simple soccer game made using Pygame. The objective of the game is to score as many goals as possible before the game is over. You control the player, and use the spacebar to shoot the ball towards the goal.

## Dependencies:
- pygame
- random
- math
- patience

## Functions:
- `player(x,y)`: Draws the player on the screen. The code for this function is almost as elegant as a professional soccer player's footwork.
- `goal(x,y)`: Draws the goal on the screen. The code for this function is as solid as a goalkeeper's defense.
- `ball(x,y)`: Draws the ball on the screen. The code for this function is as light as a soccer ball, and just as bouncy.
- `show_score(x,y)`: Shows the current score on the screen. The code for this function is as reliable as a referee's whistle.
- `show_over()`: Shows the "Game Over" message on the screen. The code for this function is as dramatic as a soccer player's injury flop.
- `is_collide(BallX, BallY, GoalX, GoalY)`: Checks for collision between the ball and the goal. The code for this function is as precise as a striker's shot on goal.

## Funny Points:
- This is my first Python project, so the code might be a bit messy. It's like a soccer game played by a team of toddlers - it's not always pretty, but it gets the job done!
- The `running` variable in the code represents the state of the game loop, but it could also describe my mental state while trying to debug this code.
- The ball in the game moves in a straight line, which is more than I can say for some of the code in this script. It's like a drunk soccer player stumbling around the field!

Enjoy playing the game, and don't forget to have fun (and maybe a little bit of patience)!
